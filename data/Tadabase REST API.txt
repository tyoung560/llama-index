Tadabase API
With the Tadabase REST API you can now easily view your tables, fields and manipulate records using industry standard REST API.

Getting Started
To get started you must first generate a new API Token for your app by going to your app settings and selecting API Keys.



With each request you must send the following 3 headers found in the API Keys settings page.

Key	Value	Notes
X-Tadabase-App-id	App ID	ID of the app. Can be found in the URL or in the API Keys page
X-Tadabase-App-Key	App Key	Key Generated automatically from the API Keys Page
X-Tadabase-App-Secret	App Secret	Secret key generated automatically from the API Keys Page
API Limits
Each plan has specific limitations as to how many API requests can be sent. There are 2 limits:

Per minute limit.
Per day limit.
With each API request, the server will respond with the current limit status of your API within the headers.

The response headers will look like this:

Minute Limits
X-RateLimit-Limit - The total allowed API requests per minute.
X-RateLimit-Remaining - Total remaining API requests for this minute
X-Retry-After - How many seconds left for this minute.
X-RateLimit-Reset - The UNIX timestamp of when this minute is up.
Daily Limits
X-RateLimit-Daily-Limit - Total API requests allowed per day.
X-RateLimit-Daily-Remaining - Total remaining API requests for this day
X-Daily-Retry-After - How many seconds until this day is over
X-Daily-RateLimit-Reset - The Unix timestamp of when the day will be reset
